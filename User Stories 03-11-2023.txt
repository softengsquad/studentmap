
- uni buildings are the priority.
- Student hotspots are useful.
- Club locations would be good.
- Filter between different types of buildings. Social, night life and food
- Supermarkets and other grocery shops
- Favoriting system

- Smart fridge compatability (lol)
- Mobile device
- Smart watch compatibility would be good
- No need to include multiple devices at the same time

- Fairly simple user interface
- Keep it standardized for people coming from google maps

- Implementing compatability with google calandars would be good for ease of use

- University bus route, include it if possible.
	- Very useful for first years as it keeps it updated
